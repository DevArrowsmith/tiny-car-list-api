# TinyCarList API

## This is the back-end of the TinyCarList web app.

The aim of the TinyCarList project is to build a mock trading site for (tiny) cars. This repository currently contains the API controllers for managing car listings (CRUD). 

The frontend is under construction. See https://github.com/GummiCode/tiny-car-list-app

This API will later be extended to handle user data such as favourites.
